### ⚙️ Objective:
To develop a sensor-based monitoring system that:
<li> Captures temperature and humidity data every 10 seconds
<li> Stores the data in a SQL relational database
<li> Activates a relay if thresholds are exceeded and user can set the treshold 
<li> Displays real-time readings in a graph on a Flutter mobile/web app

### 🔩 Hardware:
<li>	ESP32 (main controller)
<li>	DHT11 Sensor (for temperature and humidity)
<li>	Relay (to trigger if limits exceeded)
<li>	OLED Display (to show live values)

### 🔑 Backend:
<li>	Backend: PHP
<li>	Database: MySQL
